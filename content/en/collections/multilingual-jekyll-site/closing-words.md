Thanks for reading through this collection, and I hope its contents can help
you set up a basic multilingual Jekyll site that is ready for contents and
extensions. This collection is long to read; if you find it verbose, please
forgive my limited English skills and accept my apology. It is also long to
write, as I spent about a week doing experiments, writing instructions, and
gathering samples and screenshots.

This collection was originally planned as a single post. When the "Localize
Site Title" section was finished, I realized that the post would be too long to
read and immediately started breaking the post into smaller pages that would
form a collection. To make navigation between the sections easier, I created a
layout file the would add links before and after each section's contents --
sharing old experience sometimes can also motivate researches on new
improvements.

Most of the things in this collection were based on my own experience in
setting up this personal site, which might provide only limited information
that is not helpful in resolving your issues. However, there are plenty of
resources about Jekyll on the Internet, written by other people, for
alternative purposes, or presented in different forms. Should you want to learn
more about Jekyll, below is a list of resources I would recommend:

- [Jekyll's official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- If you are working with a theme, the theme's documentation (if any) will be
  your best friend. For Minima, its documentation is accessible
  [here](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/README.md).
- [This site's source repository](https://github.com/Leo3418/leo3418.github.io)
  if you want to see how things on this site work under the hood
