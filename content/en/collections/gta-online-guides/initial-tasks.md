In the next part of this collection, I will introduce some tasks you can
complete while you are still new to this game. These tasks will familiarize
yourself with some concepts and mechanisms in GTA Online, help you earn some
money to start your career, and prepare yourself for other activities in the
game.

The first thing I would like you to know is that there are several [ways to
keep interference from other players away](learn-to-protect-yourself). Please
remember to use those tools if you would like to have a gaming experience
without unwanted interruptions.

Before you create your GTA Online character, it is a good idea to learn the
best way in my opinion to [customize your character's initial
stats](max-out-stats#stats-in-character-creator), which may save you a lot of
effort to max them out later on.
