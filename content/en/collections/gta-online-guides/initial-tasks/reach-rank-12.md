You have got some cash to start your GTA Online career, but your Rank might
still be very low. In GTA Online, you need higher Ranks to unlock more weapons,
vehicle modifications, abilities, Missions, and other miscellaneous activities.
This article gives an overview on how to rank up in the early stage of the
game. More specifically, this article covers ways to get RP quickly before you
reach Rank 12.

## Why Rank 12

Rank 12 is a very important Rank in GTA Online because it unlocks Heists. First
of all, Heists give a lot of RP upon completion, so once you have access to
Heists, you can rank up quickly. Next, when you complete the Fleeca Job, the
first Heist in the series, you unlock the [Trade Price](null) of the armored
variant of Karin Kuruma, a very important vehicle in GTA Online. It is
bulletproof, which makes it your best friend in many Missions.

## Ways to Rank Up

At lower Ranks, because you haven't unlocked many rewarding Missions that give
lots of RP, you can only use some primitive ways to get more RP. Fortunately,
you only need 33,400 RP to get to Rank 12.

### Collectibles

In GTA Online, there are lots of collectible items on the map, and each item
successfully collected gives you 1000-2000 RP. This means to reach Rank 12, you
just need to obtain at most 34 collectible items, which is not hard as long as
you have a vehicle.

There are multiple types of collectibles as shown in the screenshot above, but
**Action Figures** and **Playing Cards** are the easiest to collect. The number
of items to collect might look overwhelming, but you do not have to collect all
of them at once. As presented in the table below, only 17 Playing Cards are
required to reach Rank 12.

Although a doubled amount of Action Figures is needed for Rank 12, each Action
Figure collected gives you $1000 additionally, so you can earn 34,000 RP plus
$34,000 by collecting 34 Action Figures. For Playing Cards, however, the reward
besides RP is only some Chips with lower monetary value that can only be used
in The Diamond Casino and Resort. In other words, you may choose to either rank
up more quickly by collecting less Playing Cards, or earn some money in
addition to the same amount of RP by collecting more Action Figures. This is
completely up to you.

| Collectible Type | RP Per Item | Number of Items to Collect for Rank 12 |  Extra Earnings   |            Guides            |
| :--------------- | :---------: | :------------------------------------: | :---------------: | :--------------------------: |
| Action Figures   |    1000     |                   34                   |      $34,000      | [Video][afv], [Webpage][afw] |
| Playing Cards    |    2000     |                   17                   | $5,600 (as Chips) | [Video][pcv], [Webpage][pcw] |

No matter which type of collectibles you choose, it is wise to collect them
systematically. Follow a guide for the chosen collectible type, like one of the
guides linked in the table, and get the items in strictly the same order as the
guide, so when you want to complete the collection in the future, you know the
place where the work should resume, as long as you still use the same guide.

### Double Rewards Events on Races or Special Game Modes

Every week, Rockstar will offer double (or sometimes, even triple) RP and cash
rewards for a specific game mode, such as Stunt Race, Transform Race, Bunker
Series, etc. These are just some entertaining Jobs in which you don't need to
worry about harsh and tough NPC enemies and can also earn reasonable amount of
RP during Double Rewards, although some of them involve PvP activities.

When you need some RP to rank up, you can find out which game modes have active
Double Rewards on [Social Club](https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/events),
and participate. Usually it would be a kind of Race, so you may try some Race
Jobs, find the ones that are quick or fun to do, and keep playing them until
you have got enough RP you need.

If you are in game, look for the `2 x RP` and `2 x $` icons shown in the Job
details page, as shown in the screenshot above.
