The weapons listed here are not as important as the essential weapons in the
previous page, but they can still be useful in a few occasions.

## Up-n-Atomizer

- Category: pistols and handguns
- Unlocked by: reaching Rank 1
- Price: $399,000

The Up-n-Atomizer is more like a toy as people usually just play with it for
fun. It can produce blasts that bounce people or vehicles upon contact but are
too weak to cause deaths or explosions.

Because of this characteristic, this gun can be very useful in Missions. If a
Mission vehicle gets stuck in something and cannot be driven out, you can hit
it with the Up-n-Atomizer so it will possibly be bounced against the obstacle
and released. Because this gun is not powerful enough to blow up a car with a
single hit, you usually don't need to worry about destroying the Mission
vehicle.

vehicle]({{< static-path img up-n-atomizer-save-vehicle.png >}})

This weapon is disabled in vehicles, so you will not see it when you switch
weapon in a car. It will share the same slot with other pistols in the Weapon
Wheel, but because pistols are less commonly used than assault rifles, MGs,
sniper rifles and shotguns in on-foot combat, it should not place new burden on
your weapon switching experience.

The only drawback of this weapon is that it is expensive. Given that it is not
very essential, you can just wait until you have enough pocket money to spend
or it is on sale.

## Proximity Mine

- Category: throwables
- Unlocked by: reaching Rank 1
- Price: $1,000 each

![Proximity Mine in Weapon Wheel]({{< static-path type=img file=proximity-mine.png l10n=y >}})

Proximity Mines are like advanced Sticky Bombs that explode automatically upon
contact, so you can just throw them out and wait until some unlucky guy passes
through them, without the need to monitor enemies and manually detonate. If you
have deployed multiple Sticky Bombs, then they can only be detonated all at
once; for Proximity Mines, however, each can be activated individually.

On the other hand, many weaponized vehicles offer a Proximity Mine upgrade,
which can possibly replace the Proximity Mines in your inventory. Any vehicle
with that upgrade applied can drop Proximity Mines on the road and has infinite
capacity of them.

## Grenade Launcher

- Category: heavy weapons
- Unlocked by: reaching Rank 60
- Price: $32,400

![Grenade Launcher in Weapon Wheel]({{< static-path type=img file=grenade-launcher.png l10n=y >}})

Effective use of the Grenade Launcher requires an accurate estimate on in what
path will the grenade you launch move, so some players might just prefer the
RPG or Homing Launcher because the movement of rockets is more predictable. But
after all, because grenades can bounce against surfaces, you might be able to
take out enemies hiding behind the other side of the wall using this weapon
when you are in-door or in small alleys.
