title: "Configure GRUB for Better User Experience"

Although GRUB now has out-of-box support for LUKS2 and Argon2id thanks to the
patches applied previously, a few additional configuration steps can still be
taken to improve the user experience of unlocking the LUKS partition from GRUB.

## Update GRUB Settings for LUKS

GRUB's default settings disregard operating systems in LUKS partitions and
therefore does not generate menu entries for them.  To let GRUB probe LUKS
partitions and create corresponding menu entries, the following option needs to
be added to `/etc/default/grub`:

```bash
# /etc/default/grub

GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y
```

## Mount the EFI System Partition

Because GRUB needs to install files to the EFI system partition (ESP), the ESP
needs to be mounted before GRUB is installed.  The mount point for the ESP can
be anywhere but `/boot` since the instructions in this tutorial encrypt `/boot`
to achieve full disk encryption.  Common choices of the mount point include
`/boot/efi`, `/efi`, and so on.

Although this is not required, storing the ESP's mount point to an environment
variable temporarily is recommended because a lot of commands below include the
mount point in their arguments, and referring to the mount point using a
variable makes running the commands easier and less error-prone.  From this
tutorial's standpoint, replacing occurrences of the actual mount point with the
variable also allows readers to choose a different ESP mount point easier
because this helps them avoid manually changing the commands in the
instructions.

For those who choose `/boot/efi` as the ESP mount point, run this command:
```console
# ESP="/boot/efi"
```

For those who choose `/efi` as the ESP mount point, run this command:
```console
# ESP="/efi"
```

Then, run these commands to mount the ESP, but remember to replace `/dev/sda1`
with the actual block device for the ESP.

```console
# mkdir -p "${ESP}"
# mount /dev/sda1 "${ESP}"
```

## Improve GRUB's Passphrase Prompt

At this point, if GRUB was installed normally, it would be functional and can
unlock the LUKS partition already.  However, it would ask for the passphrase
immediately when it launches, before even showing any menu entries:

![GRUB asks for passphrase directly when it starts]({{< static-path img
grub-start-unlock.png >}})

This might be an acceptable behavior, until an incorrect passphrase is entered,
in which case GRUB would directly fall back to the rescue mode without giving a
chance to reenter the passphrase:

![GRUB falls back to the rescue mode directly if authentication fails when it
starts]({{< static-path img grub-start-unlock-failure.png >}})

To avoid this behavior of GRUB, move the `/boot/grub` directory to the ESP,
then create a symbolic link to the new directory under `/boot`.

If a new Gentoo installation is being performed, or an existing installation
where GRUB is not used is being worked with, then please run the following
command:

```console
# mkdir "${ESP}/grub"
```

If GRUB is already being used as the bootloader, please use this command
instead to move existing GRUB files to the ESP:

```console
# mv /boot/grub "${ESP}"
```

Then, **in both cases**, run the following command to set up the symbolic link:

```console
# ln -s "${ESP}/grub" /boot
```

Now, GRUB's passphrase prompt is deferred until a menu entry that requires the
LUKS partition to be unlocked is selected, and if an incorrect passphrase is
entered, GRUB no longer falls back to the rescue mode.  Instead, the user can
press any key to return to the menu and reselect the same menu entry to reenter
the passphrase.

![GRUB allows authentication retry]({{< static-path img grub-unlock-failure.png
>}})

Moving the contents of the `/boot/grub` directory to the ESP resolves this user
experience issue by making all critical files GRUB needs for full
initialization available before the LUKS partition is unlocked.  By default,
GRUB installs bootloader files to two locations: the ESP for the EFI executable
file, and `/boot/grub` for other files, including the GRUB configuration file
`/boot/grub/grub.cfg`, which contains the menu entries.  If GRUB cannot access
`/boot/grub/grub.cfg` when it launches, it has to ask for the passphrase before
being able to read the file and thus showing the menu entries.

Because GRUB supports customization of these install paths, an alternative
solution is to override the default paths via extra arguments to GRUB's
commands so everything is installed into the ESP directly, making the symbolic
link unnecessary.  But in this case, users must remember to keep overriding the
defaults every time they invoke a GRUB command.  For example, when they run
`grub-mkconfig` to regenerate the GRUB configuration file, they need to use
command `grub-mkconfig -o "${ESP}/grub/grub.cfg"` instead of the conventional
default `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`.  The symbolic link helps avoid
this: users can keep using `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg` and relying
on GRUB's default behaviors.

## Install GRUB

Now, GRUB is ready to be installed/reinstalled as normal:

```console
# grub-install --target x86_64-efi --efi-directory "${ESP}"
# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

Once GRUB has been successfully installed, the system is ready to reboot into
the Gentoo installation on the new LUKS partition.

If you are using SHA-512 for your partition (or a hash algorithm that is not
SHA-256), you must append `--modules=gcry_sha512` to the `grub-install` command,
as GRUB automatically adds `gcry_sha256` without checking the actual hash algorithm
in use.
{.notice--info}

In some cases, depending on your machine, the bootloader may
immediately fail trying to decrypt your Argon2-encrypted partition. It will immediately
claim "Invalid passphrase" after submitting your password. This error is most likely
due to the EFI binary being unable to allocate the default Argon2 memory cost of 1 GiB and
GRUB emitting a misleading error message as a result. To confirm, type `set debug=all`
then `cryptomount -a` to retry with debugging messages enabled and see if it has
trouble allocating the requisite memory for the desired LUKS2 keyslot (not the other
keyslots not meant for your passphrase). You can lower the amount of memory via
`cryptsetup luksChangeKey -S <key-slot> --pbkdf-memory <memory-in-KiB>
<other params copied from original> /dev/sda2`. This will require you to input your
password thrice (once to decrypt and gain the ability to make modifications, twice
to confirm a "new" password that you do not need to necessarily change, yet it still
asks you anways). Lower memory cost is not necessarily harmful to your security as
`cryptsetup` automatically adjusts the time cost factor upon recognizing your desired
lesser memory cost amount, but you can always binary search for the maximum memory cost
amount that GRUB can work with in 20 steps (since the default memory cost is 2^20).
