If a new Gentoo installation is being performed, then the system is now ready
to be installed using the [Gentoo Handbook's][gentoo-handbook] instructions.
If an existing installation is being encrypted, then the full system backup for
it can now be restored.  Then, for both cases, some extra system configurations
that fully enable LUKS2 and Argon2id support are required.
