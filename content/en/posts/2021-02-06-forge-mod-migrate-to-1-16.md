It is no longer news that Minecraft Forge has stable Minecraft 1.16 support, as
the first recommended build for 1.16.x, which is Forge 34.1.0, was released in
September 2020, very soon after I published [the previous blog post for this
serires][config-screen] about an update to my mod project.  Development of
Forge for Minecraft 1.16.x already had significant progress when the update for
my mod was worked on, and I contemplated adding support for 1.16 along with
that update.  However, after a hard attempt to port my mod to Minecraft 1.16, I
decided that because many method names in the Minecraft API source code
decompiled by MCP were still not fully *deobfuscated*, Forge on 1.16 was still
immature, and my mod's update would not ship with 1.16 support.

When I saw the first recommended build for 1.16.x, I downloaded it to find out
whether the deobfuscation was complete.  I was disappointed: a build that still
consisted of lots of meaningless obfuscated method names should never qualify
as a stable build in my opinion, but Forge developers decided to say that "this
build is production-ready and recommended", [dropping official support for
Minecraft 1.14.x at the same time][1.14-eol].  An implication of Forge ending
support for a Minecraft version is that if you ask a question about it on the
official forum, [you][eol-thread-msg-1] [will][eol-thread-msg-2]
[see][eol-thread-msg-3] a moderator coldly replying "your version is no longer
supported, please update to receive support", and ruthlessly closing the
thread, preventing other community members from offering a helping hand.  So
you release an incomplete version and deprecate an older stable version,
forcing people who don't want to be on the bleeding edge to use 1.15.x?  I
almost wanted to curse Forge developers for this stupid decision and Forge
forum moderators' frigid treatment of forum threads about unsupported Minecraft
versions.

My wait for a Forge build that I think is truly stable continued, and it went a
little longer than it should have been, as I got busy with other things in my
life.  Deobfuscation was satisfactory [by October 2020][mappings-update], which
helped me complete the majority of the migration to Minecraft 1.16.  The only
thing that stopped me from finalizing the port was a redesign of text
components API in Minecraft itself.  My mod needs to read chat messages
delivered to the client in their original form, i.e. with the [formatting
codes][formatting-codes], for detecting the start of a Bed Wars game and
registering purchases of team upgrades.  Unfortunately, Minecraft's internal
method for getting a chat message in formatted form was removed in 1.16 without
replacement, so I had to figure out a way to reconstruct a formatted message
myself.  This was actually not as hard as I had imagined, but I chose to save
it for later and did not revisit it until recently.

<p>{{ "**What Is Deobfuscation?**" | markdownify }}</p>

<p>{{ `To answer this question, let us first look at what *obfuscation* is.
[Obfuscation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)) is a
technique used by software developers who are so eager to protect their
software from reverse engineering that they are afraid of other people getting
even a tiny clue about how their software is implemented from mere peeks
through the function/method names in the program.  More specifically,
obfuscation entails scrambling function/method names into meaningless symbols,
preventing other people from guessing what a function/method does from what it
is called.` | markdownify }}</p>

<p>{{ `Mojang has been obfuscating Minecraft for a very long time, and this can
definitely be a barrier for people who want to write modifications to the game.
The [Mod Coder
Pack](https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/plugin/internals/mcp.html) (MCP)
was created to remap obfuscated method names in decompiled Minecraft source
code to better names that actually tell those methods' purposes.  This process
is called **deobfuscation**.` | markdownify }}</p>

<p>{{ print
`The result of a complete deobfuscation is *MCP mappings*, which consist of
reasonably meaningful method names (*MCP names*) enough to give us a rough idea
of what each method does, like ` "`getMainWindow`" ` for example.  But those
method names are not all generated by magic: they are available thanks to
developers' efforts.  When an MCP name is not available for a method, it will
be assigned a *Searge name* from *Searge mappings*, which can be something
like ` "`func_228018_at_`" `.  I would call Searge mappings *partially*
deobfuscated because at least a method's Searge name is different from its
original name in the Minecraft binary, but it still does not tell the method's
purpose, so I would not call it a complete deobfuscation.` | markdownify }}</p>

<p>{{ `It would not be easy to work with a Minecraft Forge release bundled with
a version of MCP that still contains significant amount of Searge names.  Look
at [this
commit](https://github.com/Leo3418/HBWHelper/commit/ddd6cecfec3c3168aba025a11ccff16583bc9b25)
for my mod, which switched to a newer version of Forge with updated MCP
mappings, and allowed me to replace the remaining Searge names with MCP names.
Would anyone prefer the scrambled Searge names to more expressive MCP names?
This is why I was unhappy about Forge releasing a recommended build with
incomplete deobfuscation.  If it were up to me, I would not stabilize Forge for
Minecraft 1.16 until all MCP mappings are done, because counting on mod
developers themselves to figure out what each method does is not a responsible
act.` | markdownify }}</p>

<p>{{ `*P.S. I hope all of us would never obfuscate the programs we write for
the sole purpose of keeping the implementation details as a secret, no matter
whether we are forced to do it by a manager or are doing it of our own
volition.  Such act is against the spirit of free software.  Everyone should
enjoy freedom to computing, which includes the freedom to study how the
programs they use are designed and implemented, and the freedom to modify them
as they wish.*` | markdownify }}</p>

Enough for rants, let us start looking at the patches to my mod that were
necessary for migration to Minecraft 1.16.

## Additional Matrix Stack Parameter of GUI Rendering Methods

Many methods pertinent to GUI rendering now requires an additional argument of
type `com.mojang.blaze3d.matrix.MatrixStack`.  If you are calling such a method
while there is already a variable called `matrixStack` in the current
namespace, then you can use that variable's value as the argument for free.
Otherwise, you may simply create a new matrix stack by calling its default
constructor `new MatrixStack()`.

For example, the following code snippet shows how a method that handles
rendering of a screen may look like.  Notice that it is calling some other GUI
rendering methods too, including `renderBackground` and `drawCenteredString`.

```java
@Override
public void render(int mouseX, int mouseY, float partialTicks) {
    // Draw the background of the screen
    this.renderBackground();
    // Draw the title
    this.drawCenteredString(this.font, title, width, height, color);
    // Call the super class' method to complete rendering
    super.render(mouseX, mouseY, partialTicks);
}
```

For Minecraft 1.16.x, the same method would be changed to the one shown below.
Notice that both the method signature and every GUI rendering method called
inside it now have an extra `matrixStack` argument:

```java
@Override
public void render(MatrixStack matrixStack, int mouseX, int mouseY, float partialTicks) {
    this.renderBackground(matrixStack);
    drawCenteredString(matrixStack, this.font, title, width, height, color);
    super.render(matrixStack, mouseX, mouseY, partialTicks);
}
```

## Removed Method for Getting a Settings Option's Display String

If you have followed [the previous blog in this series][config-screen] to
create a configuration GUI for your mod, then you need to make changes to every
usage of `SliderPercentageOption` and `IteratableOption`.  The
`net.minecraft.client.settings.AbstractOption.getDisplayString()` method, which
returns the option's translated name, was changed to a protected method
`getBaseMessageTranslation()`, so there is no available public method left in
the `AbstractOption` class that can return the option's name.  If you still
want to display the same translated option name as before, you must generated
it in your own code by passing the translation key to method
`I18n.format(String)` and concatenating the result with a colon.

```java
import net.minecraft.client.settings.SliderPercentageOption;
import net.minecraft.client.settings.IteratableOption;
import net.minecraft.util.text.StringTextComponent;
import net.minecraft.client.resources.I18n;

// For SliderPercentageOption
this.optionsRowList.addOption(new SliderPercentageOption(
        "hbwhelper.configGui.hudX.title",
        min, max, step,
        unused -> (double) ModSettings.getHudX(),
        (unused, newValue) -> ModSettings.setHudX(newValue.intValue()),
        // BiFunction that returns a string text component in format "<name>: <value>"
        (gs, option) -> new StringTextComponent(
                // Use I18n.format(String) to get a translation key's value
                I18n.format("hbwhelper.configGui.hudX.title")
                + ": "
                + (int) option.get(gs)
        )
));

// For IteratableOption
this.optionsRowList.addOption(new IteratableOption(
        "hbwhelper.configGui.dreamMode.title",
        (unused, newValue) ->
                ModSettings.setDreamMode(DreamMode.values()[
                        (ModSettings.getDreamMode().ordinal() + newValue)
                                % DreamMode.values().length
                ]),
        (unused, option) -> new StringTextComponent(
                I18n.format("hbwhelper.configGui.dreamMode.title")
                + ": "
                + I18n.format(ModSettings.getDreamMode().getTranslateKey())
        )
));
```

This inevitably leads to repetitions of translation keys in the source code,
but it is the most straightforward solution I can find at this moment.  After
all, we are depending on the internal and undocumented API of Minecraft, so
anything can change.

As an alternative, you may choose to extend the `SliderPercentageOption` and
`IteratableOption` classes to gain access to the protected
`getBaseMessageTranslation()` method, but this involves creating two new
classes.

## Removed Method for Getting Formatted Text

Many Minecraft players should be familiar with [formatting
codes][formatting-codes] starting with the section sign character `§`.  They
can be used to colorize text and control text other text styles like bold and
italic.  Text containing one or more formatting codes is called *formatted
text*.

In Minecraft, there is an internal interface
`net.minecraft.util.text.ITextComponent`, which is the interface for text
component objects.  Almost every piece of text you see in Minecraft has an
underlying text component object that represents it.  The `ITextComponent`
interface had a `getFormattedText()` method that could return the text being
represented by the text component with formatting codes but is removed in 1.16,
and now there is not any convenient way to obtain the formatted text from a
text component as before.

The ability to read chat messages in formatted text form is pivotal to my mod's
core features.  It [detects the beginning of a Bed Wars game][game-detector] by
checking if the client receives the introductory message Hypixel generates when
a game starts.  It [monitors the chat][team-upgrades] to see if the player's
team have purchased a team upgrade.  Although it is still possible to get and
parse chat messages without formatting codes in 1.16, this would make my mod
vulnerable to attacks from other players who know how it works.  They would be
able to send a chat message like "Leo3418 has purchased Heal Pool" to trick my
mod into registering the Heal Pool team upgrade when nobody in the team has
actually bought it.  The current implementation of my mod defends against such
attacks by matching chat messages with formatting codes, because players cannot
send formatted chat messages, and all text messages with formatting codes are
sure to be originated from Hypixel.

To deal with this problem, I have written [my own utility
method][text-components] that takes an `ITextComponent` instance and returns
the formatted string for it, and then all I need to do is to replace usages of
the removed `getFormattedText()` method with calls to my utility method.
Minecraft 1.16's API is still providing enough methods for recreate a string
with formatting codes by hand, but such procedure is a little bit complicated,
so I encapsulated it into a standalone method to reuse the code for different
modules in my mod.

```diff
- String formattedMsg = event.getMessage().getFormattedText();
+ String formattedMsg = TextComponents.toFormattedText(event.getMessage());
```

If you are facing the same issue, you are free to use the file that contains my
utility method in your own mod, because my mod is released as free software
under GNU GPLv3 or later with additional permissions, as long as you follow the
[license terms][mod-license].

## Additional Parameter of Method for Sending Chat Messages

The `net.minecraft.entity.Entity` class contains a `sendMessage` method which
allows you to send messages to the user via in-game chat:

```java
import net.minecraft.client.Minecraft;
import net.minecraft.util.text.StringTextComponent;

// Pre-1.16 way to send a chat message from the mod to the player
Minecraft.getInstance().player.sendMessage(new StringTextComponent("hello, world"));
```

But in Minecraft 1.16, this method requires an additional `java.util.UUID`
argument for the UUID of the player sending the chat message.  This argument is
only used if you are trying to send a message to another remote player
connected to the current multiplayer game from your mod.  If you are just
sending a message to the local player represented by an instance of
`net.minecraft.client.entity.player.ClientPlayerEntity`, this argument will be
ignored, so you can specify whatever value for it, including `null`.  If you do
not like passing in `null` arguments, you can follow Minecraft's practice of
using this method of its own, which is supplying the `NIL_UUID` constant for
the argument:

```java
import net.minecraft.client.Minecraft;
import net.minecraft.util.Util;
import net.minecraft.util.text.StringTextComponent;

Minecraft.getInstance().player.sendMessage(
        new StringTextComponent("hello, world"),
        Util.NIL_UUID
);
```

## Mandatory License Field in `mods.toml`

Starting from Minecraft Forge 34.1, the `mods.toml` file for your mod must
contain a `license` field, whose value is intended to state the name of your
mod's license.  You can look at [the change to my mod's `mods.toml`][mods-toml]
for an example.

## New Method for Closing a Screen

**Note:** This section is only applicable to Minecraft Forge 35.1.x and earlier
(which corresponds to Minecraft 1.16.4 and earlier).  Please ignore the
contents of this section if you are developing on Minecraft Forge 36.1.x (for
Minecraft 1.16.5) or later versions.
{.notice--warning}

Unless we are Mojang employees, we have access to only the decompiled version
of Minecraft source code, which is not expected to have any documentation, so
any knowledge we can have about Minecraft's API can only come from interpreting
and analyzing the decompiled source code, plus experience gained mainly in
trial-and-errors.  And the empirical knowledge I have about closing a screen
implemented based on Minecraft's `net.minecraft.client.gui.screen.Screen` class
is:

- The `onClose()` method in the `Screen` class should complete any teardown
  tasks when the screen is being closed, and it must contain a call to
  `net.minecraft.client.Minecraft.displayGuiScreen(Screen)` in order to switch
  back to the parent screen.

- By default, when the user presses the Esc key in a screen, its `onClose()`
  method will be called.  Therefore, calling the `onClose()` method is *the*
  way to let a screen close.

In Minecraft 1.16, the intent of the `onClose()` method has been changed:

- When the Esc key is pressed, the new `closeScreen()` method in the `Screen`
  class is now called instead.  The default implementation of `closeScreen()`
  only contains a call to `Minecraft.displayGuiScreen(Screen)`.

- `onClose()` should only contain code that needs to be executed when the
  screen is being closed.  It **must not** call
  `Minecraft.displayGuiScreen(Screen)`; otherwise, an error would occur.

- Hence, if you would like to close the current screen, you should no longer
  call the `onClose()` method.  Instead, you can either directly call
  `Minecraft.displayGuiScreen(Screen)` or, as a better way, use the
  `closeScreen()` method.  Both methods would eventually cause the `onClose()`
  method to be called.

How does this actually look?  Consider a class like this:

```java
/*
 * OK for 1.14.4 and 1.15.x, but not 1.16.x
 */

import net.minecraft.client.gui.screen.Screen;
import net.minecraft.client.gui.widget.button.Button;
import net.minecraft.client.resources.I18n;

public final class ConfigScreen extends Screen {
    /** The parent screen of this screen */
    private final Screen parentScreen;

    public ConfigScreen(Screen parentScreen) {
        // Set screen title
        super(new TranslationTextComponent("hbwhelper.configGui.title",
                HbwHelper.NAME));
        this.parentScreen = parentScreen;
    }

    @Override
    protected void init() {
        ...
        // Add a "Done" button for leaving this screen
        this.addButton(new Button(
                horizontalPosition, verticalPosition, width, height,
                I18n.format("gui.done"),
                // Action performed when the button is pressed
                button -> this.onClose()
        ));
    }

    /** Executes tasks before this screen is closed, then closes this screen */
    @Override
    public void onClose() {
        // Save mod configuration
        ModSettings.save();
        // Display the parent screen to close this screen
        this.minecraft.displayGuiScreen(parentScreen);
    }
}
```

To port this class to Minecraft 1.16.x, it needs to be modified as this:

```java
/*
 * OK for 1.16.x, but not 1.14.4 or 1.15.x
 */

import net.minecraft.client.gui.screen.Screen;
import net.minecraft.client.gui.widget.button.Button;
import net.minecraft.client.resources.I18n;

public final class ConfigScreen extends Screen {
    private final Screen parentScreen;

    public ConfigScreen(Screen parentScreen) {
        super(new TranslationTextComponent("hbwhelper.configGui.title",
                HbwHelper.NAME));
        this.parentScreen = parentScreen;
    }

    @Override
    protected void init() {
        ...
        this.addButton(new Button(
                horizontalPosition, verticalPosition, width, height,
                // By the way, the type for button text is also changed
                // from String to ITextComponent
                new TranslationTextComponent("gui.done"),
                // Note that another method is used to close the screen instead
                button -> this.closeScreen()
        ));
    }

    /** Only executes tasks before this screen is closed */
    @Override
    public void onClose() {
        ModSettings.save();
        // Must NOT call Minecraft.displayGuiScreen(Screen) here!
    }

    /** Closes this screen (New method added in 1.16) */
    @Override
    public void closeScreen() {
        // The method call to display the parent screen is moved to here
        this.minecraft.displayGuiScreen(parentScreen);
    }
}
```

## More

There must be many other changes to Minecraft 1.16.x and Minecraft Forge that
require mod developers to patch their mods if they want to migrate to the new
game version.  This blog surely cannot cover all of them; rather, its intention
is to share my experience in resolving issue that can happen throughout the
migration and present to you a solution if you run into an identical problem.
I hope it is useful to you!  If you need more resource, you can look at the
[source code of version 1.2.1 of my mod for Minecraft 1.16.x][mod-src] for some
real examples.
