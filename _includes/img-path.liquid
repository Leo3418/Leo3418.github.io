This file provides two variables, 'img_path' and 'img_path_l10n', for getting
paths to the images for the current page. 'img_path' returns the default path,
whereas 'img_path_l10n' returns the path to images localized for the page's
language.

To use these variables, use the 'include' tag to include this file, and those
variables will then become available after the 'include' statement.

Note: if the 'include' statement is placed between the front matter and the
body in a Markdown file, then to let Jekyll generate excerpt for that document
correctly, there must be no empty lines between the 'include' statement and the
body.
