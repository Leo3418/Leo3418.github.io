This file provides a 'res_path' variable for getting paths to the resources for
the current page.

To use the variable, use the 'include' tag to include this file, and that
variable will then become available after the 'include' statement.

Note: if the 'include' statement is placed between the front matter and the
body in a Markdown file, then to let Jekyll generate excerpt for that document
correctly, there must be no empty lines between the 'include' statement and the
body.
