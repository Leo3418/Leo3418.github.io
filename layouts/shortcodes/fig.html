{{/*
Renders Markdown content and wraps the resulting HTML structure in a <figure>
element.  Compared to Hugo's built-in 'figure' shortcode, this one allows the
figure's image and <figcaption> to be defined in its inner content instead of
parameters, so the definitions can be written in Markdown, which is easy and
straightforward.

It is recommended that this shortcode is used together with the 'figcaption'
shortcode in the same directory.  For example:

{{< fig >}}
![Alternate text for the image](image-url)
{{< figcaption >}}
Image caption.  Backticks are permitted, even if the caption is separated into
multiple lines.  This is not possible with Hugo's built-in `figure` shortcode.
{{< /figcaption >}}
{{< /fig >}}

The following example demonstrates the problem this shortcode solves:

{{< figure src="image-url" caption=`
Raw string literal captions like this one do not work with the built-in
`figure` shortcode because it contains backticks, which cannot be escaped.
` >}}

This is a closing shortcode; the content between the opening and closing
shortcode tags are taken as the Markdown content to render.
