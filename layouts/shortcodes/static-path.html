{{/*
Based on this site's convention for organizing static files, returns the full
relative path of a static file to the site base URL.  The returned path's value
depends on the current page's permalink, section, kind, and draft status.

This site's static files are organized in the following convention:
- The files are organized by their types under different directories in the
  union of all static directories, like 'static/img/' for images, and
  'static/res/' for miscellaneous resources.
- Under each type's directory are static files of that type for the section of
  this site whose name is the same as the directory, such as
  'static/img/collections/' for all images used in the 'collections' section,
  and 'static/res/posts/' for all resources used in the 'posts' section.

With respect to the basic conventions above, the exact path relative to a
section's directory is determined as follows:
- For each post that is not a draft: The post's date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format,
  followed by a hyphen, and the last element of the post's permalink with any
  extension stripped.  e.g. '2006/01/02/lorem-ipsum.html' ->
  'static/img/posts/2006-01-02-lorem-ipsum/'
- For each draft post: The string 'drafts/', followed by the last element of
  the post's permalink with any extension stripped.  e.g.
  '2006/01/02/lorem-ipsum.html' -> 'static/img/posts/drafts/lorem-ipsum/'
- For each page in other sections: The page's permalink relative to the root of
  the section it is in, with any extension stripped. e.g.
  - 'collections/hugo/shortcode.html' ->
    'static/img/collections/hugo/shortcode/'
  - 'collections/hugo.html' -> 'static/img/collections/hugo/'

Finally, under every path derived from the above rules, a directory whose name
is the same as a locale's language code (i.e. what '.Language.Lang' returns)
can be optionally created to store localized static files for the locale.  Any
static files not in such a directory are unlocalized files that may be shared
across all multilingual variants of the site.  For example:
- 'static/img/posts/2006-01-02-lorem-ipsum/en/' contains the post's images
  that are localized for English
- 'static/img/posts/2006-01-02-lorem-ipsum/' is for images that can be shared
  among all locales

Named Parameters:
- type: The static file's type, such as 'img' and 'res'
- file: The static file's base name, like 'hugo.png'; optional -- if not
  specified, the root path to all static files of the specified type (without
  trailing slash) is returned instead
- l10n: Optional -- if specified and not empty, then a path to the file's
  localized version for the current locale will be returned
- abs: Optional -- if specified and not empty, then the absolute path to the
  file will be returned instead of the relative path

Positional Parameters:
- 0: Equivalent to the 'type' named parameter
- 1: Equivalent to the 'file' named parameter
- Remaining positional parameters:
  - If they contain "l10n", then a path to the file's localized version for the
    current locale will be returned
  - If they contain "abs", then the absolute path to the file will be returned
    instead of the relative path
