The Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack is a paid add-on to GTA Online that gives
the owner GTA$1M and the ability to claim some properties, vehicles, weapons
and cosmetic items for free. Rockstar's advertisement claims that all the items
included in it are worth more than GTA$10M and would let the players buying it
"jumpstart their criminal empires."

Later, Rockstar introduced the Grand Theft Auto V: Premium Online Edition,
which is the original game bundled with the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack.
Sometimes, this edition is also referred to as "Premium Edition".

On Steam, PlayStation Store and Microsoft Store, both the standard edition,
which includes only the game itself, and the Premium Online Edition are
available.

On Epic Games Store, however, the Premium Online Edition (referred to as
"Premium Edition" there) is the only available option.

## Should I Buy the Bundle With the Starter Pack?

{% comment %}
A note for future: Rockstar has announced the plan to release a standalone
version of GTA Online in the second half of 2021. After that becomes real,
update the information here!
{% endcomment %}

New players often ask which bundle of the game they should buy. Some of them
are confused by what is contained in each bundle; others wonder if the Criminal
Enterprise Starter Pack is helpful at all.

First and foremost, **the Premium Online Edition is *not* required for playing
GTA Online**. Even if you buy the standard edition with GTA V itself only, you
will get access to GTA Online. The Premium Online Edition's name can be
misleading, as some people, even including me when I was new to this game,
think it is the only edition that contains GTA Online. This is wrong. Every
edition of GTA V you can purchase includes GTA Online.

Everyone who owns GTA V on PC can play GTA Online for free; on consoles, you
need paid subscription to PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold to play GTA
Online, but the subscription is **all** you need to join the multiplayer mode
as long as you own GTA V, regardless of which bundle you own.

Because you are not required to buy the Premium Online Edition to play GTA
Online, purchase of the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack becomes voluntary.
But, the screenshots above show that the Premium Online Edition's price might
be the same as the standard edition, depending on your gaming platform. If you
don't need to spend additional money on the Starter Pack, why don't you go for
it?

On the other hand, if the standard edition of GTA V is on sale but the Premium
Online Edition is not, which can happen on Steam sometimes, buying the bundled
version with the Starter Pack requires some deliberation. To find out whether
you should get the Starter Pack when you need to pay extra money, let us look
at what is included in it.

## Contents

A full list of items included in the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack can be
found at [Rockstar's official
website](https://www.rockstargames.com/GTAOnline/starterpack). While some of
the items are useful, others are probably not.

### Useful Items

#### GTA$1,000,000

Imagine someone gifts you something which is worth $100 but is not what you
like. Would you like to exchange it for a $100 gift card, so you can buy what
you want? I think everyone will answer "yes". The GTA$1M included in the
Starter Pack is just like a gift card: you can spend it freely on anything you
want to have.

In addition to the free cash in the Starter Pack, you can also [complete some
easy tasks to get another GTA$1.25M](your-first-1-25m). So, you will be able to
have $2.25M to start your GTA Online career.

#### Maze Bank West Office

Of course, this is the cheapest office, but as mentioned in the [Offices
Guide](offices-guide), this is not a bad choice if you don't have enough money
for a more expensive Office. You can buy the Del Perro Heights Apartment if
having an Office close to your Apartment matters to you.

#### Great Chaparral Clubhouse

In the [Clubhouses Guide](clubhouses-guide), I said the location of your
Clubhouse should not matter because you are not likely to make frequent visits
to it. As long as you own a Clubhouse, you are good to start MC-related
activities. And the free Clubhouse in the Starter Pack will save you $200,000.

#### Senora Desert Cash Factory

This is the cheapest Cash Factory, located at [the greatest place for MC
Businesses](null) in my opinion. The Cash Factory is not the most profitable
passive business, but it is not a bad one. If you purchase a Nightclub later,
the Cash Factory will also grant you an additional source of income in the
Nightclub Warehouse.

#### Marksman Rifle

[Marksman Rifle](essential-weapons#marksman-rifle) is one of the essential
weapons in my weapon recommendations. It is useful in missions that require you
to do stealth kills. Some PvP players also favor this weapon.

### Optional Items

The items listed here can be useful in some cases, but you still can live your
life without them.

#### Frogger Helicopter

When you don't have access to flying vehicles like Oppressor Mk II, a
helicopter is the best tool for moving around the map quickly. Having your own
helicopter is great; however, LSIA and Sandy Shores Airfield often spawn
helicopters, so even if you don't have a chopper, you can steal one from those
places.

What is more, the Frogger does not have any weapons, so you can use it merely
for transportation, not combats against NPCs. For the latter purpose, the
Buzzard Attack Chopper is a better choice.

#### 1337 Exceptionalists Way Garage

This is only a 10-car Garage which can only be used to store your vehicles. In
order to do Heists, you might want to buy a high-end Apartment, which also
includes a 10-car Garage. Unless you really have more than 10 vehicles to
stash, you can just use the Garage of your Apartment rather than a dedicated
one.

#### 1561 San Vitus St Apartment

Like all Apartments, this free Apartment included in the Starter Pack can be
used as a spawn point. But it is a low-end Apartment with a tiny 2-car Garage,
which cannot be used for Heists. In order to unlock Heists, please get a
high-end Apartment. Nevertheless, you can still claim this one since you can
own multiple Apartments.

### Cosmetic Items

Once you have the Starter Pack, there are many outfits, clothes and tattoos you
can get for free.

Besides these player customization items, the Starter Pack also includes a few
coupes, sports cars and motorcycles, which are not the best ones with the
greatest performance. I am classifying them as cosmetic items as well because
they do not make any significant difference to your GTA Online gaming
experience, but some players, especially car collectors, might want to have
them.

I want to make a special remark on the Dune FAV, the only weaponized vehicle in
the Starter Pack. It is neither bulletproof nor very resistant to explosions,
and its weapon can be controlled by the passenger only, not the driver. Thus,
this vehicle is weak in combats. You can play around with the Dune FAV, but
please don't expect to knock down lots of enemies with it.

### Items to Avoid

If the cosmetic items are not very useful but still OK to have, then the
following things in the Starter Pack **should not be claimed at all**.

#### Paleto Forest Bunker

This is the infamous Bunker I have [criticized in the article about Paleto Bay
properties](paleto-bay-properties#paleto-forest-bunker). **Do not get it; the
Gunrunning business run with this Bunker is very unlikely to be profitable**.

#### Compact Grenade Launcher

I have given reasons not to buy this weapon
[before](not-recommended-weapons#compact-grenade-launcher). To summarize, this
weapon is less powerful than the regular Grenade Launcher, and using it on
motorcycles is dangerous. As mentioned multiple times before, a smaller weapon
collection is more preferable in GTA Online. So, if you are not sure whether
you should have this weapon, then **don't claim it at all**.

#### Compact Rifle

This weapon has not been mentioned in this collection so far. It is an assault
rifle that can be used on motorcycles, just like the Compact Grenade Launcher
be the heavy weapon available on motorcycles. But, why not just use an AP
Pistol instead? The AP Pistol can be used on not only motorcycles but also
cars, and its performance is comparable to assault rifles, so it is the weapon
you can use everywhere. To keep your weapon inventory compact, **you should not
go for the Compact Rifle**, but use AP Pistol and Special Carbine instead.

## Re-Evaluation of the Starter Pack's Value

The fact that all the things included in the Starter Pack are worth more than
GTA$10M is true. However, as I have shown in the discussion above, only a few
items in it are really useful. Let us calculate the value of all "useful items"
and "optional items" combined:

| Item                              |        Price   |
| :---                              |        ----:   |
| GTA$                              |   $1,000,000   |
| Maze Bank West Office             |   $1,000,000   |
| Great Chaparral Clubhouse         |     $200,000   |
| Senora Desert Cash Factory        |     $845,000   |
| Marksman Rifle                    |      $15,750   |
| **All Useful Items**              | **$3,060,750** |
| Frogger Helicopter                |   $1,300,000   |
| 1337 Exceptionalists Way Garage   |     $112,500   |
| 1561 San Vitus St Apartment       |      $99,000   |
| **All Useful and Optional Items** | **$4,572,250** |

Ignoring all the cosmetic stuff and items you should not purchase, the value of
all interesting contents in the Starter pack is no more than $4.6M.

## Advice

If the Premium Online Edition, which is the game bundled with the Criminal
Enterprise Starter Pack, is sold at the same price as the game itself or an
even lower price, then you should get it without a second thought.

Otherwise, subtract the price of the game itself from the price of the Premium
Online Edition. For example, the standard edition of GTA V is sold at $29.99,
and the Premium Online Edition is $35.18 on Steam, so the price difference is
$5.19. Are you willing to pay that amount of money for in-game items worth
GTA$4.6M? Your answer to this question determines whether you should buy the
Premium Online Edition.

Here are some rough estimates on the time and effort required to earn GTA$4.6M
for common grinding methods:

- About 7 Pacific Standard Jobs with 55% cut (assuming your team lose no more
  than $62,500 of your take in each Finale), which can take 8 hours or more
- 3 full sales (333 crates, 111 each) from your large Special Cargo Warehouses
- About 60 top range vehicles exported from your Vehicle Warehouse (assuming
  you lose no more than $4,000 to repair cost and market value loss per car on
  average)
- 85 hours of Bunker production

If you have a friend who can host The Diamond Casino Heist for you and is
willing to give you the maximum cut, then things will become much more easier.
You can get $4.6M from about 3 Casino Heists, which typically require 3 to 5
hours when the time for Prep Missions is accounted.

Thus, if you can find people who will carry you, then you only need a few hours
of gameplay to earn the money equivalent to the Starter Pack's real value. In
this case, the Starter Pack's marginal utility is low. Otherwise, as a
lone-wolf player, you might have a hard time in getting enough money to buy
business properties, and the Starter Pack could come in useful.
