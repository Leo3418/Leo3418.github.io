Before talking about what weapons to purchase, it might be a good idea to know
how weapon selection works in GTA Online, so you can get a motivation for
decreasing the number of weapons you should own.

In GTA Online, there are two methods to switch the active weapon:

- When you are on foot, you use the Weapon Wheel to switch the active weapon.

- If you are in a vehicle, then for both keyboards and controllers, there is a
  button to cycle through all weapons you can use; the Weapon Wheel is not
  shown at all.

Note that weapon selection in GTA Online is the same as in the Story Mode,
except how in-game time progresses when the Weapon Wheel is brought up. The
Weapon Wheel in GTA Online does not slow down in-game time, whereas the Weapon
Wheel in the Story Mode does. If you need to go through a lot of weapons to
find the one you want, this can give you a disadvantage in moments when you are
supposed to change your weapon quickly, like some difficult Missions or PvP
activities.

## Weapon Wheel

The Weapon Wheel consists of 8 slots; each slot is for a single category of
weapons. Starting from the top slot and going in clockwise direction, the
weapons included in each slot are:

1. Pistols and handguns
2. Machine guns (MGs) and submachine guns (SMGs)
3. Assault rifles
4. Sniper rifles
5. Fists (unarmed) and melee weapons
6. Shotguns
7. Heavy weapons
8. Throwables and the Jerry Can

For any category, if you have only one weapon that belongs to it, then when you
select the category's slot in the Weapon Wheel, that weapon will be active.

If you have more than one weapon for a category, then when you choose the
category's slot in the Weapon Wheel, you can see an indicator like `< 3 / 4 >`
under the weapon's name, which means the current weapon is the third weapon in
this category, and you own four weapons that fall under this category in total.
There are key bindings/buttons for both keyboards and controllers to scroll
through weapons in a slot.

### Removing a Weapon

Have you wondered how many players would like to have the most basic Pistol,
which is given to every new character, removed from their inventory?
Unfortunately, this is not possible. Once you own a weapon, there is no way to
permanently get rid of it.

You do have the ability to drop some weapons, but if you own them, they will
come back to the Weapon Wheel when you switch to another session or log into
the game next time.

So far, the best thing you can do to have a weapon removed from the Weapon
Wheel is to hide some weapons using [gun lockers](gun-lockers), but they are
only working under certain conditions, as discussed in the linked article.

### No Way to Reorganize Weapons

When one of my friends purchased the game and directly jumped into GTA Online,
he thought he could choose whichever eight weapons he likes to display in the
eight Weapon Wheel slots. No one can do this: as mentioned above, each slot is
for a specific category, and this is hard-coded into the game. You can neither
let your favorite pistol show up in the assault rifles' slot nor swap positions
of the heavy weapons' slot and the shotguns' slot.

In addition, the order of weapons in the same slot is also fixed. For example,
the sniper rifles' slot always has Sniper Rifle for the first weapon, Heavy
Sniper for the second one, and Marksman Rifle for the last. There is no way to
let Heavy Sniper be the first weapon shown in this category.

In other words, you cannot customize how weapons you own show up in the Weapon
Wheel at all.

#### Order of Weapons in the Same Grid

But how does the game actually sort weapons in the same category? I cannot
present an exhaustive list of all weapons because I (obviously) don't own all
of them, but I can still give you some orderings that deserve attention. These
orderings are collected from the Weapon Wheel in the Director Mode, which
should not differ too much from their counterparts in GTA Online.

- Pistols and handguns
  1. **Pistol**
  2. Combat Pistol
  3. Pistol .50
  4. SNS Pistol
  5. Heavy Pistol
  6. Vintage Pistol
  7. Marksman Pistol
  8. AP Pistol
- MGs and SMGs
  1. **Micro SMG**
  2. Machine Pistol
  3. SMG
  4. Assault SMG
  5. Combat PDW
  6. MG
  7. Combat MG
  8. Gusenberg Sweeper
- Assault rifles
  1. **Assault Rifle**
  2. Carbine Rifle
  3. Advanced Rifle
  4. Special Carbine
  5. Bullpup Rifle

I have made the name of the first weapon in each category bold because they are
the default weapon in the category they belong to. Pardon my rudeness, but
**all of them are garbage**.

- The Pistol is in no way better than the AP Pistol. After all, as an automatic
  handgun, the AP Pistol delivers a faster fire rate comparable to assault
  rifles.
- The Micro SMG is not the best weapon in all possible use cases. You can use
  it in a vehicle, but why don't you use the AP Pistol instead, which causes
  more damage per shot? If you use it on foot, why don't you use another gun
  like Special Carbine, Combat MG or Assault Shotgun, all of which have better
  performance?
- The Assault Rifle is a total trash because it has the slowest file rate among
  all weapons of the same category.

This means that the default weapon in each of those categories is never the
most optimal choice if you own other weapons that are way more better.
Fortunately, you are only forced to own the Pistol. If you don't buy the Micro
SMG and Assault Rifle at all, then you don't need to bother having garbage
weapons as your default choice. So, **only buy the weapons you really need**.

### Picked-up Weapons

You can pick up weapons dropped by NPCs and other players. They will be added
to your Weapon Wheel. If you drop those weapons in a timely manner, they will
not be added to your permanent weapon inventory. If you have not reached the
Rank to unlock it, you cannot keep the weapon at all, and it will disappear
once you leave the game.

There are also some locations in the map that spawn weapon. If you have reached
the Rank to unlock a weapon and pick it up from one of those spawn points, the
weapon is permanently added to your inventory. So, **please be extremely
careful and do not pick up weapons spawned in the map if you don't want them**.
I accidentally picked up a Sniper Rifle in the map and wished to get rid of it
because I had already owned the Heavy Sniper Mk II, but even Rockstar Support
could not help me remove the weapon.

### Parachute

If you have a parachute in your inventory, you can see an icon for it at the
bottom-right corner of the Weapon Wheel. If you get two parachutes, there will
be a number "2" near the icon.

## Weapon Selection in Vehicle

When you switch the active weapon in a vehicle, the Weapon Wheel will not show
up; instead, there will just be a bubble showing the active weapon and the
amount of ammo. To change weapon, you have to go through all weapons you may
use in the current vehicle by tapping the weapon selection button/key in
vehicle control, until the one you are looking for is selected.

![Weapon selection in
vehicle]({{ img_path_l10n }}/weapon-selection-in-vehicle.png)

On PC, you can set up a key binding for changing to the previous weapon when in
vehicle, so you may go back if you have gone pass through the weapon you want;
if you use a controller, you can only iterate over the weapons in one way: if
you have passed through, you can't go back and have to do another iteration.

If you are in an aircraft, you can also check any parachute you own from the
parachute icon shown below the weapon bubble.
