This article introduces things you should look for in most cases when selecting
locations of your business properties. They are not absolute rules that you
must follow; in fact, these things are only general guidances for businesses
that you will sell products from, which should be the most common purpose for
many business properties. Sometimes, players (including myself) buy a property
only for a subset of the abilities it grants, which makes some of the following
criteria no longer relevant.

## Close to a Highway

Most of the business sell missions in GTA Online require you to drive one or
more delivery vehicles from your property to some drop-off points. If your
property is close to a highway in the map, then you can complete the sale
faster and easier.

The sell missions usually have a time limit: if you cannot deliver all products
before the timer goes to zero, then you cannot receive full payment from the
buyer, so you will want to complete them quickly. On highways, good road
condition is guaranteed, the road is wide enough to allow you pass slow NPC
cars safely, and there are less crossings where you might encounter NPC drivers
changing lanes suddenly, all of which allows you to drive faster without paying
too much attention to the traffic.

## Not Located at a Corner of the Map

A business management mission usually requires you to travel to one or more
places. For sell missions, you will be given drop-offs; for others, like
Special Cargo Buy Missions, vehicle stealing mission in Import/Export, you also
need to go out and deliver the cargo to your warehouse. These places are
located sparsely throughout the map:

- The buy/steal missions in Special Cargo/Vehicle Cargo happen in Los Santos
  County, but the places can be in downtown Los Santos, Vinewood, or even in
  the sea to the south, near LSIA or Port of South Los Santos.

- The drop-off points of Nightclub sell missions can be at everywhere on the
  map, from Paleto Bay to Elysian Island.

- The Bunker and MC Businesses allow you to choose whether you want to sell to
  Los Santos or Blaine County, but the drop-offs are still sparsely distributed
  in the county you select.

Thus, business properties that are closer to the center of the map are better
than the ones located at the map's corner. Generally, I do not recommend any
property in the following locations because they increase the distance you need
to travel to complete a business management mission:

- Paleto Bay and Paleto Forest
- LSIA
- Elysian Island

## It is OK to Pay More for a Good Location

You should never let the price be the constraint on selecting the location of
your property, especially if you are planning to use it for a long term. For
most types of property, please do not consider buying it at a mediocre location
with lower price first and moving to a better place after you earn more money
with it. There are several reasons against this act.

First, although you can trade in a property you already own towards a new one,
the credit you get for the old property is in no doubt going to be lower than
the full price you paid for it. At last, this option costs more money than
paying for a better location at the beginning. This is not the same as
smartphone trade-ins in real life: because there will new smartphones that are
better than the one you currently own every year, you might want to upgrade
your phone every few years for better hardware; but in GTA Online, we have
never seen addition of new locations for an existing type of property, so the
best location will be the best forever.

Next, the actual amount of extra money you need to pay in this act is higher
than what you have possibly imagined. Many properties in GTA Online are
upgradable, and I like to describe the price for the upgrades as ["the hidden
cost"](null). There are upgrades that are not shown to you until you purchase
the property, and many of those upgrades are vital for making your business
even profitable. If you are counting on the new property to earn enough money
to move to a better location, you should purchase these upgrades. The problem
is, you have to purchase them again for the new property after you move, in
full price.

Therefore, I strongly suggest you increase your budget and buy a property at an
accessible location on your initial purchase. If you don't have enough money,
just make more with Heists, Contact Missions, or even [the methods I introduced
before for quick cash](more-methods-to-earn).

## My Location Choices

I am glad to show you the properties I have purchased in case you are
intersted. I play two characters: the first character was started earlier so I
have made further game progress with it; for the second character, I have only
purchased some passive businesses to generate additional income when I play it.

Properties owned by the first character:
- Fort Zancudo Hangar 3497
- Alamo Sea Coke Lockup
- Sandy Shores Clubhouse
- Grand Senora Desert Meth Lab
- Grand Senora Desert Cash Factory
- Grand Senora Desert Facility
- Chumash Bunker
- Insert Coin Arcade
- Maze Bank West Office
- Del Perro Nightclub
- Darnell Bros Warehouse
- Logistics Depot
- La Mesa Vehicle Warehouse

Properties owned by the second character:
- Fort Zancudo Hangar 3497
- Alamo Sea Coke Lockup
- Great Chaparral Clubhouse
- Grand Senora Desert Meth Lab
- Grand Senora Desert Cash Factory
- Grand Senora Desert Facility
- Farmhouse Bunker
- Eight-Bit Arcade
- Downtown Vinewood Nightclub
- Maze Bank West Office

![Second character's properties]({{ img_path }}/char2.png)

My choices of property locations generally follow the criteria mentioned above.
The first character has a chain of properties along the Western Highway and Del
Perro Freeway, including the Bunker, Arcade, Office, Nightclub, and Vehicle
Warehouse. The second character's properties, including the Nightclub and
Bunker, are closer to the Los Santos Freeway in the east. The MC Businesses and
Facility are served by Route 68. There are no properties located near Paleto
Bay or other places at the map's corner. I will give more explanation for each
location choice when it comes to the discussion on the business associated with
the property.
