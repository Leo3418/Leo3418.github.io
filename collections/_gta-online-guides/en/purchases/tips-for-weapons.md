Besides the suggestions what which weapons to buy and not to buy, here are some
other weapon tips that are good to know.

## Don't Buy Ammo in Ammu-Nation

If you refill ammo for your weapons in Ammu-Nation, there will be a very high
chance that you accidentally purchase a gun you don't need.

I would recommend the following methods to purchase ammo, which are safe and
more effective:

1. Start a Contact Mission, and select "Purchase All Ammo" in the Mission
   set-up screen. This allows you to buy ammo for all your weapons at regular
   prices. Then, you can leave the Mission without starting it.

2. Open up the Interaction Menu, select "Inventory" and then "Ammo", then
   browse through the weapons you own to purchase rounds for them. Notice that
   the rounds' prices will be slightly higher than normal.

If you need to buy special ammo for any Mk II weapon you own, you have to visit
a [Weapon Workshop](mk-ii-weapons#prerequisites). Such process is also
error-prone, but there is no alternative way to buy special ammo, so please be
careful when browsing weapons in a Weapon Workshop.

## Choosing Default Weapons in GTA Online's Weapon Wheel

If you own multiple weapons in the same grid of the Weapon Wheel, you can
choose the default weapon for the grid by selecting that weapon in the Story
Mode's Weapon Wheel. For more details, please refer to [this
article](https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/205926188/How-to-Set-Default-Weapons-in-the-Weapon-Wheel-for-GTA-Online)
on Rockstar Support website.

According to my own experience, this method has the following limitations:

- Because there are no Mk II weapons in Story Mode, you cannot choose a Mk II
  weapon as a default one.

- You must have unlocked and purchased the default weapons you want to select
  in Story Mode. If this does not apply to you, you may download and load a
  save in which all Story Mode Missions have been completed, or if you like it,
  do those Missions to unlock the weapons.

- Occasionally, the default weapon selections are not applied after you leave a
  Mission.
