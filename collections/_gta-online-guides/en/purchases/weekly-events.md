Every week, Rockstar creates an event where rewards for some activities are
increased, and in-game items, like vehicles and business properties, are
discounted.

## Timeline

As of now, new weekly events come into effect on about 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM UTC
every Thursday. When a new event is active, the previous event ends
immediately.

For this reason, you will often hear existing players who have played GTA
Online for a while telling you that "on Wednesdays, you should not buy anything
not on sale or sell from your businesses without any bonus". If you can wait
for only one more day, it is possible to save some money thanks to a new
discount, or earn more money from increased rewards.

What is more, you should wrap up anything you want to do that will make the
most of the current event on Wednesdays. Buy any on-sale items in your
wishlist; sell any product that has a bonus; complete any Heists or Missions
while they still offer increased payout. On the next day, the prices will go
back to their normal, and the payouts will return to the regular values.

## Viewing the Current Event

Rockstar does not release the details about the new event immediately when it
is online. Instead, the event's information is published on approximately 4:00
PM to 6:00 PM UTC every Thursday.

The place where the events are most prominently posted is Rockstar Games Social
Club. You can find the list of current and past events in
<https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/events>. Keep in mind that events for Red
Dead Online are also shown at the same place; look for events labeled with
"Grand Theft Auto Online".

Alternatively, you may go to [Rockstar Games
Newswire](https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/) for a cooler presentation of
the current event.

Thanks to [Tsuikyit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Call_Me_Tsuikyit/), a member
of the [GTA Online Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/), you can
also find an unofficial summary of the new event before Rockstar's
announcement. The summary is pinned in the GTA Online Subreddit, so you should
be able to find it easily.

## Rewards

Almost every week, Rockstar will give doubled or tripled GTA$ and RP rewards on
one type of races or Adversary mode. Examples include Stunt Races, Open Wheel
Races, Arena War Series, Bunker Series, etc. These game modes are not giving a
lot of rewards to the participants; for new players, however, taking part in
the game mode with active Double or Triple Rewards is a great way to earn some
pocket money. By completing a 2x GTA$ and RP race, you can usually get about
$10,000 to $20,000.

In addition, Rockstar usually offers another reward for Missions, Jobs, or
even business activities. The common type of bonus is doubled GTA$ and RP
rewards for Contact Missions and Freemode activities. The rarer but also better
bonus is increased payout of business sell missions. Such type of bonus occurs
about only once per month on average, but it is lucrative since it allows you
to earn millions of GTA$ in a week. If you need money, you should definitely
keep an eye on any bonus for sell missions of a business you own.

### Recommendations

Below are some best activities for players who usually play alone. They are
manageable with only one player, so if you are a lone wolf, make sure to
exploit any events for the following:
- [Bunker](null)
- [Special Cargo](null)
- [Nightclub Warehouse](null) (rare)

If you have buddies, then you can also participate in events for the following
activities:
- [MC Businesses](null) -- you may do this alone, but it is a lot more easier
  with two or more players
- [Casino Heist](null)
- [Doomsday Heists](null) (rare)
- [Heists](null) (very rare)

Some other activities might not pay as much as the ones above, but depending on
your circumstances, they might also be worth doing when there is a Double
Rewards event targeting them:
- [Contact Missions](null) -- good for ranking up quickly
- [Client Jobs](null)
- [VIP Works](null)

## Discounts

Cars, motorcycles, planes, helicopters and even boats are often seen on the
list of discounted items in a weekly event.

Occasionally, Rockstar puts a certain kind of business properties on sale,
usually when there is also a bonus on sell missions of that business. This is
the perfect time to start a business you do not own yet and use it to generate
massive income immediately.
