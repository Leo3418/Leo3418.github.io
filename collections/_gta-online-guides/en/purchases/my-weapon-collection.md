In the following articles, I will introduce the weapon loadout I an using in
GTA Online. You can regard this as a weapon recommendation, but if you choose
to follow the advice to keep your arsenal small, perhaps the weapons
recommended in the following articles are also the only weapons you should buy.

- [Essential Weapons](essential-weapons)

- [Optional Weapons](optional-weapons)

- [Mk II Weapons](mk-ii-weapons)

In addition, please also check out [this page](not-recommended-weapons) about
some weapons that are not recommended, along with the reason.
