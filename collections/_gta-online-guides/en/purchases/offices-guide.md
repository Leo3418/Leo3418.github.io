In GTA Online, there are four purchasable Office properties, each of which
grants you the ability to register as a CEO and access to Special Cargo and
Import/Export business.

## Buy an Office

From your in-game phone, open "Internet", and select "Money and Services" in
the navigation bar. Then, click on www.dynasty8executivereality.com to open up
the Dynasty 8 Executive website, from which you can purchase an Office.

## Office Locations

The four Offices are all located in Del Perro and Pillbox Hill.

![Office Locations]({{ img_path }}/office-locations.png)

| Office                   |   Price    |   Location   |
| :-----                   |   :---:    |   :------:   |
| **Entry-level Offices**  |
| Maze Bank West           | $1,000,000<br />(Free with Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack) |  Del Perro   |
| Arcadius Business Center | $2,250,000 | Pillbox Hill |
| **Luxurious Offices**    |
| Lombank West             | $3,100,000 |  Del Perro   |
| Maze Bank Tower          | $4,000,000 | Pillbox Hill |

Based on their price level, I would divide the four Offices into two classes:
entry-level and luxurious ones. All Offices offer the same functionality, and
the only differences between Offices in those two classes are cosmetic things
and price tag.

If you don't have a lot of money to spend on an Office, then you should buy one
of the entry-level Offices to minimize the cost to start new businesses. After
you have got enough money, it is never too late to move to a luxurious Office
to enjoy the beautiful view of Del Perro Beach while lying in your office
chair. Therefore, in this discussion about Offices, I will focus on those two
entry-level Offices.

### Recommendation

The Arcadius Business Center Office is located in Pillbox Hill, which is a
better location than Del Perro, where the Maze Bank Office locates, due to its
proximity to the center of the map. On the other hand, Maze Bank West is the
cheapest Office, and it is even free if you have got the Criminal Enterprise
Starter Pack.

Unless you have enough money to purchase the Arcadius Business Center Office,
it is perfectly fine to go for Maze Bank West in order to save more than one
million of GTA$. After all, Maze Bank West is close to Del Perro Freeway, so
except potentially increased travel time, it is still accessible.

In addition, **the Office itself cannot give you any income, and to make money
from it you need to purchase a Special Cargo Warehouse or Vehicle Warehouse,
which will cost additional money**. You should add the price of any warehouses
you want to buy to your budget for the Office before making the purchase.

| Properties | Total Price |
| :--------- | :---------: |
| Maze Bank West Office and<br />La Mesa Vehicle Warehouse | $2,500,000<br />($1,500,000 with Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack) |
| Arcadius Business Center Office | $2,250,000 |

This table shows that if you have got GTA$2.5M and decide to go with Arcadius
Business Center, then you will have no money for anything else. With about the
same amount of money you can get the Maze Bank West Office plus a Vehicle
Warehouse, and you can start collecting income from Import/Export. Remember,
**the Office alone generates no profit at all**.

### Case Study: Buying the Office Near Your Apartment

I have seen someone asking about which Office he should purchase given that he
had already owned the 4 Integrity Way Apartment. The person was looking for an
Office that is close to his Apartment so he could get to the Office quickly
after joining a session.

He was considering Arcadius Business Center because he had just enough money
for it, and it is just across the street from 4 Integrity Way, as introduced in
the ["Apartment Locations"](apartment-locations#4-integrity-way) page. However,
I still recommended Maze Bank West to him because if he would buy Arcadius
Business Center Office, there would be no additional funding for any warehouse,
and the Office alone would be useless. Despite the warning, he still strongly
preferred the Office near his Apartment.

Some people love to have their Office close to their Apartment. If you also
have such a preference and will be broke after buying Arcadius Business Center,
then you should consider purchasing Del Perro Heights Apartment plus Maze Bank
West Office instead. Those properties are also very close to each other, and
they are way more cheaper than Arcadius Business Center Office alone:

| Properties | Total Price |
| :--------- | :---------: |
| Maze Bank West Office and<br />Del Perro Heights, Apt 7 | $1,200,000<br />($200,000 with Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack) |
| Arcadius Business Center Office | $2,250,000 |

Don't want to give up the 4 Integrity Way Apartment? Sure, you can keep that
Apartment because you may own up to 8 Apartments at once in GTA Online.

**TL;DR: If you prefer Arcadius Business Center because of its propinquity to
your Apartment, but you don't have a lot of money, then you should buy Maze
Bank West Office plus an Apartment in Del Perro Heights instead.**

## Importance of Office Location

The Office is the place where you will start import missions of both Special
Cargo and Vehicle Cargo. You will source cargo from the computer in your
Office, get the cargo, and deliver it to the warehouse.

When you sell the cargo, you will initiate the sell mission from the warehouse
where the cargo is, instead of your Office. Therefore, the location of your
Office does not affect the sell missions.

After you own the [Terrorbyte](null), the location of your Office will no
longer matter at all because you can start source missions from the
touch-screen computer in Terrorbyte's Nerve Center, and since you can drive
your Terrorbyte to anywhere, the source missions can also be initiated
anywhere.

After you get the [Master Control Terminal](null) in an Arcade, you can also
start all source missions from your Arcade.

The conclusion is that your Office's location only affects the import missions
of CEO businesses, and its importance is no longer relevant once you have got
the Terrorbyte or the Master Control Terminal. Thus, don't worry too much about
not selecting the best Office location on the first purchase.

## Summary

- For beginners, it is strongly advised to purchase the cheapest Maze Bank West
  Office. Although its location is not the best, it will still be worth every
  penny you pay for it.

- Buy the Arcadius Business Center Office judiciously. Keep in mind that you
  must buy at least one warehouse in addition to the Office to make profit from
  the CEO businesses, so be prepared to pay more than the price you see at the
  first glance.

- If you feel compelled to buy the Arcadius Business Center Office only because
  it is close to 4 Integrity Way and you own that Apartment, then consider the
  combination of Maze Bank West and Del Perro Heights Apartment, which is
  cheaper and still offers a very short home-to-office distance. GTA Online
  allows you to own more than one Apartment.

- The other two more expensive Offices are not suitable for beginners. Use a
  cheaper Office first, and switch to a luxurious one after you are rich if you
  still want it.

- Other properties, like Terrorbyte and Master Control Terminal in Arcades,
  decrease the importance of a good Office location.
