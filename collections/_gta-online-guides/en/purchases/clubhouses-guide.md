Clubhouses in GTA Online offer the ability to do the following things to their
owner:

1. Start a Motorcycle Club.

2. Purchase factories for Motorcycle Club Businesses.

3. Start Clubhouse Contracts, which are some Freemode activities that offer
   a small payout.

4. Store up to 10 motorcycles.

For abilities 1 through 3:

1. You can start an MC from the Interaction Menu everywhere on the map.

2. Once you have purchased the MC Business factories in your Clubhouse, you
   manage each Business entirely from the laptop in the factory. The only
   purpose of the Clubhouse's laptop is to let you buy those factories, so you
   need not come back to your Clubhouse to manage your Businesses.

3. There are better Freemode activities which are easier and offer greater
   payouts than Clubhouse Contracts. Loosely speaking, those activities can be
   started from everywhere in the map, but the Clubhouse Contracts must be
   initiated from your Clubhouse.

Therefore, the location of Clubhouse matters only if you want to stash your
motorcycles in it or you really like doing Clubhouse Contracts. In this case,
just choose whatever Clubhouse that works for you, because they are all very
cheap. Even the most expensive Clubhouse is priced at only $495,000.

Otherwise, you could buy the cheapest Clubhouse if you will not make frequent
visit to it after purchasing the MC Businesses, because the location of a
property you are not going to access physically is not important. The cheapest
Clubhouse is the **Great Chaparral Clubhouse**, whose price is $200,000. If you
have the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack, then you can claim it for free.
