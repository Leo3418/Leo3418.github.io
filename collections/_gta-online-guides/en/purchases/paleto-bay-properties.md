This has been mentioned more or less in the previous parts of this collection,
but it is worth emphasizing it again since it is a mistake that so many players
will make:

Do not buy a property located near Paleto Bay only because it is cheap, when
such location has a very significant disadvantage.

More specifically, you should never consider Paleto Forest Bunker if you want
to make money with it, no matter what kind of offer on it is available to you.

## Properties Near Paleto Bay

On the Maze Bank Foreclosures website in the game, there have been five
properties near Paleto Bay as of this article was written: two Clubhouses, one
Facility, one Arcade, and one Bunker.

In the [Clubhouses Guide](clubhouses-guide) I said that the location of your
Clubhouse should not matter at all in most cases, so it is definitely fair to
buy any of the two Clubhouses in Paleto Bay. Remember though, the cheapest
Clubhouse is the Great Chaparral Clubhouse on Route 68, not any of the two
Paleto Bay Clubhouses.

I have mixed opinions on the Facility. As the starting point of all Doomsday
Heist missions, the role of a Facility's location is comparable to that of your
Apartment's place in original Heists. Sitting at the corner of the map, the
Paleto Bay Facility is not the best choice in general. However, it is the
optimal Facility for The Bogdan Problem's Finale. Some players keep redoing
that mission because it is easy and has decent payout. If you are interested in
redoing it too, then the Paleto Bay Facility is a reasonable choice.

The Arcade is used for The Diamond Casino Heist, so its purpose is similar to
that of Facility. But, if you want to do the Casino Heist, then you should
avoid this Arcade. Most of the Preps for the Casino Heist take place in Los
Santos or the southern part of Blaine County that is close to the city. The
Finale will of course require you to go to the Casino in East Vinewood. By
choosing another Arcade in Los Santos, you will save yourself and your
teammates a lot of time.

The Bunker is free for Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack owners, but you should
never claim it. We will get to this in a moment.

There are also some MC Businesses near Paleto Bay. They are not being sold on
Maze Bank Foreclosures, so the screenshot above does not include them. Because
Paleto Bay is not a suitable location for business properties, and the cheapest
MC Businesses are located near Sandy Shores, there should be no reason to buy
them at Paleto Bay.

## Paleto Forest Bunker

I will give more details about sell missions from the Bunker later, but here is
one thing: you can either do a near sale to Blaine County or do a far sale to
the city of Los Santos for 50% additional cash bonus. The set of missions for
both types of sales is the same, so the only difference between them is the
distance you need to travel to complete the sale. Thus, for greater profits,
players should always choose to sell to Los Santos.

Paleto Bay is located at the northernmost corner of the map, so it is the
farthest destination from the city. To sell from the Paleto Forest Bunker and
collect the maximum payout, you need to drive the delivery vehicle(s) to the
city first, which can take four to five minutes, depending on the type of
vehicle you are given. Keep in mind that all Bunker sell missions are timed,
and some of them only gives you 15 precious minutes. It would be very hard to
even complete the sell mission in time when you get multiple drop-offs and
vehicles. Should you use this Bunker, you will have horrible experience with
your Gunrunning business.

People who can claim the Paleto Forest Bunker for free thanks to the Criminal
Enterprise Starter Pack might think they can use this free Bunker temporarily
just to make enough money for a better Bunker, but this is not a wise decision.
Recall [the hidden cost](the-hidden-cost) of the upgrades required to make your
Bunker profitable.  When you move to another Bunker, any upgrades you have
purchased will not be transferred, so you need to spend another $1,753,500 on
the necessary upgrades for the new Bunker, which is roughly equal to the price
of a Bunker closer to the city!
