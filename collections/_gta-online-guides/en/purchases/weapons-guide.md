A good collection of weapons can be very helpful in passing Missions and
Heists. But, a large arsenal is not necessarily a good one because sometimes
less is more, and this applies to the number of weapons you own in GTA Online.
Due to the reasons discussed [at the beginning of this
collection](general-tips-for-beginners#keep-a-minimal-collection-of-weapons),
it is important to keep the number of weapons you own to the minimum. The
upcoming section gives you information about weapon mechanisms in GTA Online
and advice about maintaining a compact but still powerful arsenal.
