Time Trial is a Freemode activity that requires you to go from point A to point
B under par time. You can use any normal land vehicle you own and take any
route.

Rockstar rotates the active Time Trial every week along with [weekly discounts
and Double Rewards](null). In each week, when you successfully complete the
active Time Trial under par time for the first time, you get an $100,000 bonus.

The Time Trial is shown on the map as a purple stopwatch icon. Go to the
location marked by the icon to start the Time Trial. If no such icon exists on
your map, you may have hidden it before; to unhide it, in the Interaction Menu,
choose "Hide Options > Other > Time Trial", and change it to "Show".

## Guides

GTA Series Videos has guides demonstrating how to complete every Time Trial
under par time.

- [2019

The 2016 Series and 2018 Series cover the same 22 Time Trials, but in almost
all of the 2016 Series videos, Pegassi Bati 801 was used, whereas newer
vehicles like Shitzu Hakuchou Drag and Ocelot Pariah were used in the 2018
Series. The 2019 Series, on the other hand, covers a brand new set of Time
Trials Rockstar added to GTA Online in the end of 2019.

## Recommended Vehicles

The **Shitzu Hakuchou Drag** used in most of the 2018 and 2019 Series demos
would definitely make completing Time Trials under par time easy; in fact, in
those demos, the recorder could often complete the Time Trial more than 10
seconds in advance. But, this motorcycle costs $976,000, so you need to
complete 10 Time Trials under par time to earn the money back.

Note: Don't confuse Hakuchou Drag with Hakuchou, which is another model sold at
$82,000. The Hakuchou Drag has better performance in acceleration.

If you'd like to have a vehicle that is both fast and cheap, then **Pegassi
Bati 801** is your best choice. You only need as little as $15,000 for a
vehicle that is capable of helping you complete most Time Trials under par
time. It is not as fast as Hakuchou Drag; if you depend on it to beat the par
time, you have to keep doing wheelies for as longer time as possible, and you
will often find yourself being only one or two seconds apart from the par time.
You might have observed this in the 2016 Series demos.

Here are several Time Trials I have completed under par time using Bati 801
with all upgrades maxed out, including some new Time Trials in the 2019 Series.
You can see that I barely beat the par time of each Time Trial, but it was
still doable with numerous attempts. For each Time Trial, I used the same route
suggested by GTA Series Videos' guide.

- LSIA II: 02:22.489/02:24.000

- Pillbox Hill: 02:11.595/02:16.000

- Elysian Island II: 01:46.880/01:50.000

- Lake Vinewood Estates: 01:25.280/01:26.000

- Del Perro Pier: 01:40.313/01:43.200

- End to End: 04:08.411/04:09.500

Note: Another variant, Pegassi Bati 801RR, can also be purchased at the same
price. They should have negligible difference in performance and only differ in
appearance.

## Remember to Take Breaks

Personally, I often find myself retrying a Time Trial over and over again
without passing it, even if I do it with the Hakuchou Drag when it is used in
the guide from GTA Series Videos sometimes. It is completely normal if you need
many attempts to beat the par time.

When the sky turns dark, or the weather becomes rainy, it's time to have a
rest. Should you keep retrying, the bad ambient condition will only make the
Time Trial harder. Come back after sunrise or after the ground becomes dry
again, and you might get better performance as the result of relaxing.

## Other Tips

- Although Passive Mode will be automatically enabled when you start a Time
  Trial, I would still suggest you do the Time Trial in an Invite Only Session.
  If you pass other players who frighten nearby NPCs, those NPCs will drive
  recklessly and thus interfere with your performance.

- It would be great if you can have a passive business running while you are
  attempting the Time Trial, so after beating the par time, you can sell from
  the business to earn more money.

- If you think you have almost stayed in the current session for 48 real-life
  minutes (1 in-game day), you should start a new session if you want to avoid
  the [daily property utility charges](null).
