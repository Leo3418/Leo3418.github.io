I often hear complaints from new players about being repeatedly killed by other
players with high Ranks but not being able to revenge or turn their back on the
fight. Of course, with weak weapons and possibly limited skills, it is hard to
take out those adversary players. However, GTA Online does provide mechanisms
that can prevent disturbance from other players. It is really unfortunate that
the game does not have a clear instruction or tutorial on those mechanisms, so
many new players do not aware of them.

I had been thinking that if I would make a GTA Online guide someday, I should
cover the ways to protect oneself from other players' attacks in the first
lesson. So here it goes: there are three different mechanisms to keep attacks
from other players away, applicable to different situations:

1. [Passive Mode](passive-mode)

2. [Non-Public Sessions](session-types)

3. [Solo Public Sessions](solo-public-sessions)
