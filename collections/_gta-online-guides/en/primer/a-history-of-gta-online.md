I have suggested [the tip to refer to GTA Online's
history](general-tips-for-beginners#refer-to-gta-onlines-history) because it
may help you understand why some components of the game were designed as they
are and thus make better decisions on what to buy and what to do in the game.
Here, I will list some significant events and updates happened to GTA Online as
accurate as I can (because I started playing this game since 2018, I did not
witness the events prior to that time); after that, I will also discuss some
important take-aways and implications of those events.

## Events

### 2013

- September 17: Although advertised as a separate title and mentioned in the
  same manner in-game, Grand Theft Auto V, what GTA Online is built on, was
  released for PS3 and Xbox 360 in select regions.

- October 1: GTA Online was launched.

### 2014

- August 19: With the *San Andreas Flight School Update*, the Flight School,
  which had been available only in the Story Mode, was added to GTA Online,
  with a completely different set of courses.

- November 18: GTA V and GTA Online were released for PS4 and Xbox One.
  Rockstar called those releases the "Enhanced Edition", as the game on these
  platforms had better video quality and additional features like first-person
  perspective and Director Mode.

### 2015

- March 10: The *Heists Update* was released. Five Heists were added to GTA
  Online, each allowing players to do a series of missions that would award
  them significant amount of money upon completion of the last mission in the
  series. The Heists were designed to be done by a team of 2 (only for the
  first Heist) or 4 (for the rest) players.

  The Heists offer a very unique multiplayer gaming experience that is rarely
  found in other online games. There are still a lot of players doing those
  classic Heists nowadays even though they were released very long ago and
  Rockstar has added more Heists with higher payouts later on.

- April 14: The Enhanced Edition of GTA V and GTA Online were released on PC.

- October 20: The *Lowriders* update was launched. It added Benny's Original
  Motor Works, an auto shop not intended to replace the existing Los Santos
  Customs but specialized for more expensive modifications. A series of
  lowrider-themed Missions given by Lamar (which I personally call "Lamar
  Missions") was also introduced with the update.

- December 15: With the *Executives and Other Criminals* update, players can
  register as a VIP, hire Bodyguards, and complete VIP Works together as an
  Organization.

### 2016

- June 7: The *Further Adventures in Finance and Felony* update was released,
  which gave players the option to purchase an Office and register as a CEO.
  Being a CEO, you have access to the SecuroServ network where you can purchase
  Warehouses and start a Special Cargo business.

  Even today, years after this update, Special Cargo is still considered as one
  of the most rewarding activities to do in GTA Online: a whole Large
  Warehouse of cargo can give you $4.44M when sold during a Double Rewards
  event.

- October 4: The motorcycle-themed *Bikers* update was available. Besides VIP
  and CEO, players got the ability to form Motorcycle Clubs, which allows
  instantly summoning a motorcycle. Motorcycle Club Businesses were also added.

  In an MC Business, you obtain Supplies either via purchases or by stealing
  them without paying a price. Then, just let your workers, who came with the
  factory you bought for the Business, generate Products for you; you can do
  anything else when they convert Supplies to Products. Finally, when you get
  enough Products to sell, do a sale mission and collect the money.

  This is often categorized as a "passive business" because you don't need to
  do anything while your investment is being transformed into revenue. In
  Special Cargo, you must actively involve yourself in transporting the Crates
  back to your Warehouse to convert the price you paid to buy them to the money
  you earn from a sale. In MC Businesses, once you buy Supplies, the only thing
  you need to do before a sale is to stay in the game and wait until your
  workers generate enough Products.

- December 13: The *Import/Export* update offered players a new kind of
  business, Vehicle Cargo, through the SecuroServ network. Anyone wants to
  start a Vehicle Cargo business should own an Office and buy a Vehicle
  Warehouse. Players can source a vehicle via SecuroServ, steal it, drive it
  back to their Vehicle Warehouse, then modify and sell it to make a profit.
  This activity involves lots of driving, and unlike Special Cargo and MC
  Businesses, it does not require investing an up-front cost for obtaining the
  goods to sell.

### 2017

- June 13: The *Gunrunning* update was released. Bunkers, the properties for a
  new passive business of selling weapons, was introduced, allowing players to
  increase their earnings while they are doing other activities in GTA Online.
  Several weaponized vehicles, new Mk II variants of existing weapons, and a
  new set of weapon accessories were also added to the game.

  In my opinion, Gunrunning is the best passive business. There are only 6
  kinds of Bunker sale missions, none of which is extremely hard; the hourly
  profit of a Bunker is the highest among all passive businesses in GTA Online.

- August 29: In the *Smuggler's Run* update, Hangars were introduced as both
  storage for the player's personal aircrafts and bases for the Air Frieght
  Cargo business, which is similar to Special Cargo but has its missions
  oriented to aircrafts. This update also featured a wide array of new planes
  and helicopters available for purchase.

- December 12: *The Doomsday Heist* update was available. Three new Doomsday
  Heists, presented in a new theme and story line, and offered with better
  payouts than the classic Heists, were added to the game. The Doomsday Heists
  worked similarly as the classic Heists, but they can be completed by any
  group of 2, 3, or 4 players. Also, as a continuation of the Gunrunning
  update, more weaponized vehicles and extra Mk II weapons became available.

### 2018

- July 24: The *After Hours* update added Nightclubs to the game. Nightclubs
  provide two separate businesses to players: the Nightclub Warehouse, which is
  yet another passive business, and the Nightclub itself, also a passive
  business that grants just a small income. This update also included Pegassi
  Oppressor Mk II, the infamous flying motorcycle that can be customized with
  missiles.

  There are two unique thing about the Nightclub Warehouse that differentiates
  it from MC Businesses and the Bunker:

  1. The only input required to earn money from it is completing the sale
     mission. You don't even need to purchase supplies to get products in your
     Warehouse; your technicians will accrue goods for you.

  2. You will always get only one vehicle for the delivery job. For other
     businesses, if you have a lot of goods to sell, you might need to operate
     multiple vehicles to complete the delivery; in Nightclub sales, you always
     get a single vehicle, though its size might vary depending on your stock.

  The types of Goods accrued by the technicians in your Nightclub Warehouse
  depend on what properties you have already owned. The more businesses you
  operate, the more products your technicians can accumulate in the Warehouse.

### 2019

- July 23: The long-awaited *The Diamond Casino & Resort* update was finally
  released. The original Vinewood Casino near the Vinewood Racetrack was
  renovated and changed to The Diamond Casino & Resort. The new casino welcomed
  players with table games, slot machines, horse racing, and a purchasable
  Penthouse. Six Casino Missions with a story line were also added.

- December 12: As a continuation of the story line in the Casino Missions, *The
  Diamond Casino Heist* update added a new Heist targeting the casino's vault.
  The form of the Casino Heist is different from the classic Heists and the
  Doomsday Heists but rather similar to Heists in the Story Mode, where the
  Heist Leader would choose the approach and hire several NPCs as crew members.
  Furthermore, except the Heist Finale, all Missions of the Heist can be done
  by a single person.

## Corollaries and Implications

- Don't bother getting Gold Medals in the Flight School of GTA Online until you
  have gained some good flying skills, possibly by completing the Flight School
  courses in the Story Mode first. Since GTA Online's Flight School was added
  about one year after the game's release, and the Story Mode's Flight School
  was already teaching basic flying controls, Rockstar designed the courses in
  GTA Online to be challenges for proficient pilots rather than tutorials for
  novice cadets.

- The Lamar Missions are not a part of the GTA Online Tutorial, nor are they a
  continuation of it. So, please don't regard them as something you must or
  should do and merrily join and play them after you have completed the GTA
  Online Tutorial.

- There are three sets of Heists in GTA Online: the classic Heists released in
  2015, The Doomsday Heists, and The Diamond Casino Heist. If you wish to
  complete all the Heists in increasing difficulty, you might want to do them
  in the chronological order of their releases. The classic Heists were a lot
  more easier than The Doomsday Heists; some aspects of mission design in The
  Doomsday Heists were intended to prevent players from reusing the tricks that
  could make the classic Heists easy.

- Every set of Heists has some requirements to be unlocked, but the classic
  Heists' prerequisites are easier to satisfy. They only require reaching Rank
  12 (which is easy) and owning a high-end Apartment (which can be purchased
  with as few as $200,000). Both The Doomsday Heists and The Diamond Casino
  Heist require being a VIP, CEO, or MC President, and a specialized property
  whose price starts from $1.2M.

  The classic Heists were released in March 2015, months before Rockstar added
  VIP as the first type of organizations a player can register. Since CEOs and
  MCs were introduced in 2016, every new major activity added to GTA Online
  required being a VIP, CEO, or MC President, including The Doomsday Heists and
  The Diamond Casino Heist.

  Inflation is also a thing in GTA Online: prices of new vehicles and clothing
  items have skyrocketed update by update, and so are the properties' prices:
  you need to pay at least 6 times more for a property that unlocks newer
  Heists than the cheapest Apartment for the classic Heists.

- If you want to exploit the Nightclub Warehouse, make sure you have owned most
  of the following:

  - A Bunker

  - A Hangar, *or* at least one Special Cargo Warehouse

  - Some MC Businesses, preferably a Cocaine Lockup, a Meth Lab, and a Cash
    Factory

  After Hours, the update that added Nightclubs, were released after all of
  those properties had been added to GTA Online. The Nightclub Warehouse was
  mainly intended to let veteran players benefit from their existing businesses
  by collecting extra passive income. If you don't own any of the properties
  above, the Nightclub Warehouse will not function at all.
