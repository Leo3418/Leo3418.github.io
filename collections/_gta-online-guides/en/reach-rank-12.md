You have got some cash to start your GTA Online career, but your Rank might
still be very low. In GTA Online, you need higher Ranks to unlock more weapons,
vehicle modifications, abilities, Missions, and other miscellaneous activities.
This article gives an overview on how to rank up in the early stage of the
game. More specifically, this article covers ways to get RP quickly before you
reach Rank 12.

## Why Rank 12

Rank 12 is a very important Rank in GTA Online because it unlocks Heists. First
of all, Heists give a lot of RP upon completion, so once you have access to
Heists, you can rank up quickly. Next, when you complete the Fleeca Job, the
first Heist in the series, you unlock the [Trade Price](null) of the armored
variant of Karin Kuruma, a very important vehicle in GTA Online. It is
bulletproof, which makes it your best friend in many Missions.

## Ways to Rank Up

At lower Ranks, because you haven't unlocked many rewarding Missions that give
lots of RP, you can only use some primitive ways to get more RP. Fortunately,
you only need 33,400 RP to get to Rank 12.

### Double Rewards Events on Races or Special Game Modes

Every week, Rockstar will offer double (or sometimes, even triple) RP and cash
rewards for a specific game mode, such as Stunt Race, Transform Race, Bunker
Series, etc. These are just some entertaining Jobs in which you don't need to
worry about harsh and tough NPC enemies and can also earn reasonable amount of
RP during Double Rewards.

When you need some RP to rank up, you can find out which game modes have active
Double Rewards on [Social Club](https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/events),
and participate. Usually it would be a kind of Race, so you may try some Race
Jobs, find the ones that are quick or fun to do, and keep playing them until
you have got enough RP you need.

### Contact Missions

Before Rank 12, you can access some Contact Missions offered by Simeon
Yetarian, Gerald, and Martin Madrazo. On average, each Mission can give you
1000-3000 RP.

I deliberately ignored Lamar Missions because I believe [they are not suitable
for beginners](general-tips-for-beginners#ignore-lamar-missions-for-now).
First, none of them can be played solo, and they require players to collaborate
well. If you are unfamiliar with those Missions, and you can't communicate with
your teammates using voice, then you might need to spend a lot of time passing
them. Second, many of them requires four players, whereas other Contact
Missions can all be done by one or two players. The more teammates who are
strangers, the greater the chance to fail the Mission. Larger number of players
might also mean longer waiting time to gather enough teammates before starting
the Mission.

#### Comparison Between Mission Categories

| Category | Typical RP Reward (for Hard Difficulty Setting) | Required Players | Mission Difficulty for Beginners |
| :----------------------- | :-------: | :-: | :------------: |
| Classic Contact Missions | 1000-2000 |  1  | Easy to medium |
| Dispatch Missions        | 2000-3000 |  2  | Medium         |
| Premium Deluxe Repo Work | 3000-4000 |  1  | Medium to hard |
| Gerald's Last Play       | 2500-3500 |  1  | Hard           |

The earliest Contact Missions do not give a lot of RP rewards, but they are
very easy to complete. You may choose to repeat doing some of those missions
for many times if you just want something simple.

Martin Madrazo's Dispatch Missions offer more RP, but they are harder than
those classic Contact Missions, especially if you don't own any of armored
Kuruma, Buzzard, Deluxo, or Oppressor Mk II. They also require at least two
players, so you can't do them solo and must either join a Job another player
hosts or start the Mission by yourself and wait until someone joins. However,
if you happen to get a teammate who uses any of the vehicles mentioned above,
then these Missions become much more easier, so this could be a plus.

The Repo Missions given by Simeon Yetarian have varying difficulties, but some
of them should still be manageable by new players. They can be completed solo
and offer more RP than Dispatch Missions. You can choose to do some easy Jobs
among them, such as **Simeonomics**, and grind more RP than what a classic
Contact Mission has to offer.

The Gerald's Last Play Missions are easy if you have an armored Kuruma and hard
if you don't. Since you can purchase armored Kuruma at a lower price after Rank
12 and there are many other Contact Missions you can do, I won't suggest buying
that car just for these Missions. So, perhaps consider ignoring them
temporarily until you get an armored Kuruma.

#### Equipment

The recommended equipment for these Missions is Special Carbine with
Suppressor. They are unlocked at Rank 1, meaning that you can buy them
directly. Special Carbine is an assault rifle with good performance; the
suppressor is useful in Missions that require stealth kills, like some Dispatch
Missions. They cost $27,250 in total.

#### Tips

- When you are starting a Mission, make sure you choose Hard Difficulty. This
  gives you more RP and cash rewards and is not significantly harder than
  Normal Difficulty.

  ![Selecting Hard Difficulty]({{ img_path_l10n }}/hard-difficulty.png)

- If you are hosting a Dispatch Mission, you need another player to start the
  Job. To find a player more quickly, you can do the following in the "Invite"
  screen:
  - Change "Matchmaking" to "Open"
  - Choose "Auto-Invite"
  - If you are in a highly populated session, you can choose "All From Current
    Session"
  - Choose "Skill Matched Players > All Skill Matched Players"
