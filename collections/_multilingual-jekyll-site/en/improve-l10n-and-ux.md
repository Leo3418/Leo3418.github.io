Now we've got a basic multilingual Jekyll site powered by Polyglot. There are
still spaces for improvements, like the small issues mentioned at the end of

enhancements to our site to make it look and work better.

**Note**: Should you plan to apply a theme to your site, please do so now. The
following steps will modify include and layout files, which vary depending on
the theme. If you add or change the theme later, you might need to redo these
steps. A site with the Minima theme applied will be used in the following
examples.
