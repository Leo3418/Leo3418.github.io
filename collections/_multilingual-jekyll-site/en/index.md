[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static website generator. It creates
static HTML documents directly, making hosting a website as easy as setting up
an HTTP server. Yet it is still very powerful: it can generate HTML documents
from [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which makes writing
and formatting articles and posts easy and fun; it supports plugins that add
more feature to itself, the generated site, or even both.

Thanks to plugin developers, we have multilingual plugins for Jekyll which
allow us to make our site useful to more people in different parts of the world
by presenting translated and localized contents. However, there are still a few
things that require extra care and some possible improvements on the site's
user experience that are not offered by those plugins, which will be covered by
the guides in this collection. We will walk through all the steps needed to set
up a multilingual Jekyll site similar to the one you are currently viewing.

The multilingual plugin I will use for this collection is
[Polyglot](https://github.com/untra/polyglot/). Of course, this is also the
plugin that this site uses as of this collection is composed. I will discuss
why I chose this plugin in a section in this collection.
